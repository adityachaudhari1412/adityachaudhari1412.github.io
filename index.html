            <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
            <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
            <p>I am Aditya Chaudhari, a graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Arlington. During my academic career, I undertook internships as a Software Engineer at Axxess Software Solutions and as a Software Developer at QT Technologies, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in software development. Currently, I work as a Maverick Academic Scholar Software Developer I at PMG Advertising Agency in Dallas, TX.</p>
            <p>I am excited to apply for the Android Developer position at Virtuix. With a strong foundation in software development and a passion for immersive gaming technology, I believe I am an ideal fit for your team. At PMG Advertising Agency, I developed JavaScript real-time collaboration tools and integrated OpenAIâ€™s GPT with Python, enhancing client satisfaction and operational efficiency. During my tenure at QT Technologies, I honed my expertise in Kotlin and Java, developing Android applications that improved the speed of web applications by 28% and reduced server costs by 46%. My experience includes working extensively with Android Studio, where I led the development of mobile solutions for aviation fueling automation, saving significant time for major airlines. I also manually signed APK builds, conducted smoke testing on physical devices, and developed cross-platform applications using React Native frameworks.</p>
            <p>At Axxess Software Solutions, I worked on automating the Revenue Cycle Management System Board using Agile Methodology, reducing processing time for insurance claims by 23% and increasing the number of processed claims by 15%. I extended key functionalities for clients, resolving over 50 existing production bugs in a large user base application. Additionally, I developed an automated multi-threaded application for both iOS and Android using the ASP.NET framework, and implemented improvements based on production logs, which increased code efficiency by 10%.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I have actively participated in peer code reviews and knowledge-sharing sessions, ensuring continuous learning and improvement within the team. I have attended AI meetups and seminars to stay updated with the latest advancements in technology and bring innovative ideas back to my projects. Shadowing senior developers has provided me with invaluable insights and practical knowledge, enhancing my ability to deliver high-quality software solutions. My proficiency in Kotlin, paired with my strong understanding of object-oriented design and agile methodologies, including TDD and Pair Programming, equips me to write and maintain high-quality code as part of Virtuix's Android platform team.</p>
            <p>I also hold certifications that further validate my skills and commitment to professional growth. I have earned the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification (June 2023) and the AWS Certified Developer Associate certification (October 2023).</p>
            <p>I am particularly inspired by Virtuix's commitment to revolutionizing virtual reality experiences and am eager to contribute to the development of Omni Oneâ€™s Android applications, ensuring robust and innovative solutions. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can contribute to the continued success and innovation at Virtuix.</p>
