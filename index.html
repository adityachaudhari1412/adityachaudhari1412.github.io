            <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
            <p>I am Aditya Chaudhari, a graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Arlington. During my academic career, I undertook internships as a Software Engineer at Axxess Software Solutions and as a Software Developer at QT Technologies, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in software development. Currently, I work as a Maverick Academic Scholar Software Developer I at PMG Advertising Agency in Dallas, TX.</p>
            <p>I am excited to apply for the Android Developer position at Virtuix. With a strong foundation in software development and a passion for immersive gaming technology, I believe I am an ideal fit for your team. At PMG Advertising Agency, I developed JavaScript real-time collaboration tools and integrated OpenAIâ€™s GPT with Python, enhancing client satisfaction and operational efficiency. During my tenure at QT Technologies, I honed my expertise in Kotlin and Java, developing Android applications that improved the speed of web applications by 28% and reduced server costs by 46%. My experience includes working extensively with Android Studio, where I led the development of mobile solutions for aviation fueling automation, saving significant time for major airlines. I also manually signed APK builds, conducted smoke testing on physical devices, and developed cross-platform applications using React Native frameworks.</p>
            <p>At Axxess Software Solutions, I worked on automating the Revenue Cycle Management System Board using Agile Methodology, reducing processing time for insurance claims by 23% and increasing the number of processed claims by 15%. I extended key functionalities for clients, resolving over 50 existing production bugs in a large user base application. Additionally, I developed an automated multi-threaded application for both iOS and Android using the ASP.NET framework, and implemented improvements based on production logs, which increased code efficiency by 10%.</p>
